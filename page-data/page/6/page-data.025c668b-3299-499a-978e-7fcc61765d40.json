WARNING !!!!!!\nThis module utilizes EdXposed Framework which is still in early development stage and may contain bugs or might not be fully compatible with system of your Android device. I take no responsibility for any issues arising from using GravityBox with EdXposed and strongly recommend creating a full backup of your device before activating the module.\n\n***THIS VERSION IS FOR ANDROID 10 (Q) ROMs***\n- For Lollipop, use GravityBox [LP]\n- For KitKat, use GravityBox [KK]\n- For JellyBean, use GravityBox [JB]\n- For Marshmallow, use GravityBox [MM]\n- For Nougat, use GravityBox [N]\n- For Oreo, use GravityBox [O]\n- For Pie, use GravityBox [P]\n\n## Main features\n- QuickSettings tile management with additional tiles\n- Pie Controls\n- Expanded desktop with semi-immersive and immersive modes\n- Lockscreen tweaks\n- Statusbar tweaks\n- Navigation bar tweaks\n- Power tweaks\n- Display tweaks\n- Media tweaks\n- Phone tweaks\n- Hardware key actions\n- Launcher tweaks\n- Screen recording\n- Smart radio\n- Notification control (per-app notification LED/sounds/vibrations)\n- Fingerprint Launcher\n- Advanced tuning of Framework and System UI parameters\n- Media Visualizer\n\n... and many more\n\n## Compatibility\n- Supports AOSP devices running vanilla Android 10\n- Supports OnePlus devices running official OxygenOS\n- Supports Pixel devices running official Google OS\n- *DOES NOT* support devices running ROMs vastly modified by device manufacturers (HTC Sense, LG, Samsung Touchwiz, MIUI, LeWa, Xperia, ...)\n- *SHOULD NOT* be used with custom ROMs like Lineage, AOSPA, or any other derivative - it makes no sense since the most of the features are already in the ROM (may cause conflicts and unexpected behavior)\n\n## Requirements\n- Magisk v20 or later\n- Riru core v21 or later (Magisk module)\n- Riru - EdXposed v0.4 or later (Magisk module; YAHFA or Sandhook whatever works best on your device)\n- EdXposed Manager\n\n## Info about premium features and PayPal transaction ID verification system\n1. Those who supported development via PayPal donation can use their PayPal transaction ID to unlock premium features. Currently there are two premium features: 1) Backup/restore of GB settings 2) Ultimate notification control\n\n2. If you contributed to the project by providing translations, code fragments, or by any other way. You can apply for a free transaction ID by contacting me via PM @ forum.xda-developers.com\n\n3. Be aware that there's a system that can identify potential transaction ID abuse. E.g. when one ID is being used by more users. Such IDs will get blocked automatically. This can also happen when you previously exposed your ID in public forum and other users took advantage of it. If this is the case, contact me via PM so I can issue new, special ID. In case you own more devices, you can use one transaction ID on up to 10 of them.\n\n4. If you are using your own custom builds of GB for personal use, you will get hash mismatch upon verifying your ID as verification system accepts requests only from official releases of GB. If you want to be able to verify IDs with your custom build, contact me via PM so I can setup a special hash for your build. If you are using a custom build that you provide for broader group of users (e.g. in a custom ROM), It is necessary to ask for new hash everytime your new custom version is released for public use. These rules are based on mutual trust so please, do not violate them.\n","summary":"All-in-one complex module for devices running vanilla Android 10 (Q)","sourceUrl":"https://github.com/GravityBox/GravityBox/tree/q","hide":false,"additionalAuthors":[],"childGitHubReadme":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"excerpt":"GravityBox [Q] GravityBox is a module which primary goal is to provide the users of devices running vanilla or close to vanilla Android with a tweak box that turns their stock ROM into a custom ROM packed with additional features and tweaks; without…"}}}},{"node":{"name":"com.programminghoch10.mobileiconchanger","description":"MobileIconChanger (Fake5GIcon)","url":"https://github.com/Xposed-Modules-Repo/com.programminghoch10.mobileiconchanger","homepageUrl":"https://github.com/programminghoch10/MobileIconChanger","collaborators":{"edges":[{"node":{"login":"programminghoch10","name":null}}]},"readme":"# [MobileIconChanger](https://github.com/programminghoch10/MobileIconChanger)\nChange your mobile data icons!

Just try it out and see if it works. \n\n[Read more about compatiblity here](https://github.com/programminghoch10/MobileIconChanger#compatibility).\n\n## Installation\n\n1. Install the module on a system with a running XPosed framework with API version `>=93`.\n1. **Activate the resource hooks** within your XPosed framework manager.\n1. Activate the module. The package `SystemUI` should automatically be selected.\n1. Restart your phone.\n1. You are now ready to use the module.

This is why this modules settings are hidden within the App-Info screen._\n\nHere is how to open the settings:\n\n- Route 1:\n    - Go to the module list within your XPosed manager\n    - Long press on `CameraControl` and select App Info\n    - On the bottom, click on `Advanced`\n    - Click on `Additional settings in the app`\n- Route 2:\n    - Go into device settings\n    - Click on apps\n    - Somehow tell the device to show all apps\n    - Select `CameraControl`\n    - On the bottom, click on `Advanced`\n    - Click on `Additional settings in the app`\n- Route 3:\n    - Open up an ADB shell\n    - Run command `am start-activity com.programminghoch10.mobileiconchanger/.SettingsActivity`\n\n## More resources\n\nI don't want to keep 4 different places up to date.\n\nIf you want to read more about \n[why this module exists](https://github.com/programminghoch10/MobileIconChanger#inspiration)\nor [additional info about the configuration interface](https://github.com/programminghoch10/MobileIconChanger#configuration)\nor [you just want to see some screenshots first](https://github.com/programminghoch10/MobileIconChanger#screenshots)\nhead over to [the GitHub Repo](https://github.com/programminghoch10/MobileIconChanger).\n","summary":"Change your mobile data icons!

Moved project from Eclipse to Android Studio\n2. Updated compile SDK version to use latest SDK (28)\n3. Updated dependencies to use online sources\n\n## Installation\n\nTo install this module you need the following apps and modules installed on your device:\n1. Magisk v18.1 and above - https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk/releases\n2. Magisk Manager v7.0.0 and above - https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk/releases\n3. Riru Magisk module v16.0 and above - https://github.com/RikkaApps/Riru/releases\n4. EdXposed Magisk module v0.3.0.0_beta2 and above - https://github.com/ElderDrivers/EdXposed/releases\n5. EdXposed Installer v2.2.1 and above - https://github.com/solohsu/XposedInstaller/releases\n\n## Known Issues\n\n- Some features are removed on purpose. Since GravityBox has been working on Samsung Oreo devices without much issues, I only implemented features that need special Samsung coding. You can check [GravityBox for Pie](https://forum.xda-developers.com/xposed/modules/app-gravitybox-v9-0-0-beta-1-android-9-t3908768) for additional features.\n- It could take some time to popup the root request, just wait a few minutes until it pops up, usually not much after the xposed installer recognized the module.\n\n## External Libraries\n\nThe project uses the following libraries:\n1. https://github.com/topjohnwu/libsu\n2. https://github.com/rovo89/XposedBridge\n3. https://github.com/rovo89/XposedMods/tree/master/XposedLibrary\n4. https://github.com/jaredrummler/ColorPicker\n5.

Most of the preferences can be changed on-the-fly without rebooting.\n\n## !!!!!! WARNING !!!!!!\nThis module utilizes EdXposed Framework which is still in early development stage and may contain bugs or might not be fully compatible with system of your Android device. I take no responsibility for any issues arising from using GravityBox with EdXposed and strongly recommend creating a full backup of your device before activating the module.\n\n***THIS VERSION IS FOR PIE ROMs***\n- For Lollipop, use GravityBox [LP]\n- For KitKat, use GravityBox [KK]\n- For JellyBean, use GravityBox [JB]\n- For Marshmallow, use GravityBox [MM]\n- For Nougat, use GravityBox [N]\n- For Oreo, use GravityBox [O]\n\n## Main features\n- QuickSettings tile management with additional tiles\n- Pie Controls\n- Expanded desktop with semi-immersive and immersive modes\n- Lockscreen tweaks\n- Statusbar tweaks\n- Navigation bar tweaks\n- Power tweaks\n- Display tweaks\n- Media tweaks\n- Phone tweaks\n- Hardware key actions\n- Launcher tweaks\n- Screen recording\n- Smart radio\n- Notification control (per-app notification LED/sounds/vibrations)\n- Fingerprint Launcher\n- Advanced tuning of Framework and System UI parameters\n\n... and many more\n\n## Compatibility\n- Supports AOSP devices running vanilla Android Pie 9\n- Supports OnePlus devices running official OxygenOS\n- Supports Pixel devices running official Google OS\n- *DOES NOT* support devices running ROMs vastly modified by device manufacturers (HTC Sense, LG, Samsung Touchwiz, MIUI, LeWa, Xperia, ...)\n- *SHOULD NOT* be used with custom ROMs like Lineage, AOSPA, or any other derivative - it makes no sense since the most of the features are already in the ROM (may cause conflicts and unexpected behavior)\n\n## Requirements\n- Magisk v19 or later\n- Riru core v19 or later (Magisk module)\n- Riru - EdXposed v0.4 or later (Magisk module; YAHFA or Sandhook whatever works best on your device)\n- EdXposed Installer\n\n## Info about premium features and PayPal transaction ID verification system\n1. Those who supported development via PayPal donation can use their PayPal transaction ID to unlock premium features. Currently there are two premium features: 1) Backup/restore of GB settings 2) Ultimate notification control\n\n2. If you contributed to the project by providing translations, code fragments, or by any other way. You can apply for a free transaction ID by contacting me via PM @ forum.xda-developers.com\n\n3. Be aware that there's a system that can identify potential transaction ID abuse. E.g. when one ID is being used by more users. Such IDs will get blocked automatically. This can also happen when you previously exposed your ID in public forum and other users took advantage of it. If this is the case, contact me via PM so I can issue new, special ID. In case you own more devices, you can use one transaction ID on up to 10 of them.\n\n4. If you are using your own custom builds of GB for personal use, you will get hash mismatch upon verifying your ID as verification system accepts requests only from official releases of GB. If you want to be able to verify IDs with your custom build, contact me via PM so I can setup a special hash for your build. If you are using a custom build that you provide for broader group of users (e.g. in a custom ROM), It is necessary to ask for new hash everytime your new custom version is released for public use. These rules are based on mutual trust so please, do not violate them.\n\nDonation is also possible by purchasing GravityBox Unlocker from the Play Store\n","summary":"All-in-one complex module for devices running vanilla Android 9 Pie","sourceUrl":"https://github.com/GravityBox/GravityBox/tree/pie","hide":false,"additionalAuthors":[],"childGitHubReadme":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"excerpt":"GravityBox [P] GravityBox is a module which primary goal is to provide the users of devices running vanilla or close to vanilla Android with a tweak box that turns their stock ROM into a custom ROM packed with additional features and tweaks; without…"}}}},{"node":{"name":"com.fankes.refusebrightness","description":"拒绝强制亮度","url":"https://github.com/Xposed-Modules-Repo/com.fankes.refusebrightness","homepageUrl":"","collaborators":{"edges":[{"node":{"login":"fankes","name":"Fankesyooni"}}]},"readme":"# 拒绝强制亮度\n\n![Eclipse Marketplace](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-AGPL3.0-blue)\n![Eclipse Marketplace](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-v1.1-green)\n[![Telegram](https://img.shields.io/badge/Follow-Telegram-blue.svg?logo=telegram)](https://t.me/XiaofangInternet)\n\n深夜拿起手机，不小心点到付款码、收款码、扫描二维码，屏幕亮度强制最高，人直接去世……\n\n请给用户一个选择，拒绝 APP 强制屏幕亮度，从我做起。\n\n## Developer\n\n[酷安 @星夜不荟](http://www.coolapk.com/u/876977)\n\n## 作用域说明\n\n- 只需勾选你需要生效的 APP 即可\n\n- 建议不要勾选系统应用以免发生异常\n\n- 模块已对系统框架设置了黑名单，勾选也不会生效\n\n## 作用域贡献\n\n- Fork 项目后 [前往这里](https://github.com/Xposed-Modules-Repo/com.fankes.refusebrightness/blob/main/SCOPE) 贡献作用域。\n\n> 目前已添加\n\n- QQ(标准版)\n- TIM\n- 微信\n- 支付宝\n\n## 适配说明\n\n- 只支持 LSPosed，请不要在其它管理器上激活模块，否则会不生效\n\n- 理论最低 Android 版本没有限制，但是 LSPosed 最低支持到 Android 8.0\n\n- 激活后的 APP 将失去设置指定 `Activity` 亮度的功能(目前设定)\n\n## 开发中的功能(按需求人数决定)\n\n- 支持根据系统特定亮度区间和指定 `Activity` 做出亮度调整功能，防止必要的设置不生效\n\n- 可配合屏幕遮罩和 Android 12 下的极暗模式自动限制调整屏幕亮度\n\n## 捐赠支持\n\n- 工作不易，无意外情况此项目将继续维护下去，提供更多可能，欢迎打赏。<br/><br/>\n  <img src=\"https://github.com/fankes/YuKiHookAPI/blob/master/img-src/wechat_code.jpg\" width = \"200\" height = \"200\"/>\n\n## 贡献\n\n本模块使用 [YukiHookAPI](https://github.com/fankes/YukiHookAPI) 构建\n\nYukiHookAPI 是一个使用 Kotlin 重构的高效 Hook API 构建工具，让你的 Xposed 模块开发变得更加简单。\n\n版权所有 © 2019-2022 Fankes Studio(qzmmcn@163.com)\n","summary":"拒绝 APP 强制设置指定活动窗口的屏幕亮度","sourceUrl":null,"hide":false,"additionalAuthors":null,"childGitHubReadme":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"excerpt":"拒绝强制亮度 Eclipse Marketplace\nEclipse Marketplace\nTelegram 深夜拿起手机，不小心点到付款码、收款码、扫描二维码，屏幕亮度强制最高，人直接去世…… 请给用户一个选择，拒绝 APP 强制屏幕亮度，从我做起。 Developer 酷安 @星夜不荟 作用域说明 只需勾选你需要生效的 APP 即可 建议不要勾选系统应用以免发生异常 模块已对系统框架设置了黑名单，勾选也不会生效 作用域贡献 Fork 项目后 前往这里 贡献作用域。 目前已添加 QQ(标准…"}}}},{"node":{"name":"space.aioilight.tsubonofuta","description":"Tsubonofuta","url":"https://github.com/Xposed-Modules-Repo/space.aioilight.tsubonofuta","homepageUrl":"https://github.com/AioiLight/Tsubonofuta","collaborators":{"edges":[{"node":{"login":"AioiLight","name":"AioiLight"}}]},"readme":"# Tsubonofuta\nF*ck ChMate's ads\n","summary":"F*ck ChMate's ads","sourceUrl":"https://github.com/AioiLight/Tsubonofuta","hide":false,"additionalAuthors":null,"childGitHubReadme":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"excerpt":"Tsubonofuta F*ck ChMate's ads"}}}},{"node":{"name":"icu.nullptr.twifucker","description":"TwiFucker","url":"https://github.com/Xposed-Modules-Repo/icu.nullptr.twifucker","homepageUrl":"https://github.com/Dr-TSNG/TwiFucker","collaborators":{"edges":[{"node":{"login":"Dr-TSNG","name":"Nullptr"}}]},"readme":"# TwiFucker\n\n## Yet Another Adkiller for Twitter\n\nThis is an Xposed module.
